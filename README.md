## Member Tasks
### Truong Son Nguyen - (ASU ID: 1225266250)
 - I am responsible for programming the handler.py file which takes events every time a user uploads a video to the input bucket and processes it to identify the student in such video. Then querying for the student's information from the DynamoDB database, parse it as a csv file and save to the output bucket.
 

### Abhradeep Roy â€“ (ASU ID: ).
 - Task
### Aman Jain  -  (ASU ID: 1224726750)
 - I mainly focussed on setting up AWS configuration and required resources for the project. For instance, I configured the required IAM roles to run lambda function. Additionally, I created an ECR repository for the lambda function where the docker image is pushed. I created a script to dump student_data.json data to the DynamoDB table. Furthermore, I worked on creating S3 buckets for input and output. When the setup was complete, I along with Abhradeep performed end to end testing to check the whole flow.
